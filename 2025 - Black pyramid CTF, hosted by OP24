## Overarching Reflections

Damn that was fun

### Additional thoughts

**Positives:**  
Really want to learn more and prepare for the next one! Authentication manipulation is intuitive and fun and SQLi seem similar and interesting.  
I wish to have deeper knowledge so I can work more with the puzzle and hint aspects of CTF and not have to focus so much on learning the basics.  
I will forever curse Cathleen, who invited me, pointed me in the direction of using burp suite and now inadvertently; added ONE MORE interest that will take up my time and energy when I thought I was content with focusing on defensive cybersec.  
This has been a formative event for me

  
**Problems & Regrets**  
Need far less reliance on LLM in the future.

I did not have basic pre req knowledge like js and dynamic webpages

used to much AI, and used it poorly

Refrained from researching solutions and instead relying on trial and error
